The sooner you get to drafting directives, the sooner you'll have a good idea about your crisis arc and your approach to committee (and we'll have more time to provide you with feedback for it).\n\nThis will be a running assignment for the rest of the semester. Submit directives and they'll get returned to you with feedback. Feel free to do so as much as you like.","materials":[{"driveFile":{"driveFile":{"id":"1vOxcN47R19AchgnY7I476QXuNaMrWMlxypBXwoc8tqY","title":"[Template] [TEMPLATE] MUN: Crisis Directives Sheet","alternateLink":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aEA7lp5dMP2nZ_O8jYV6f7I-JlcBA1xL__Wcsd97XFI","thumbnailUrl":"https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1aEA7lp5dMP2nZ_O8jYV6f7I-JlcBA1xL__Wcsd97XFI&sz=s200"},"shareMode":"STUDENT_COPY"}},{"driveFile":{"driveFile":{"id":"16HHhGE2OdH4SwB6i3sHjd0aKjpjzYHenHZAhwaxvmiM","title":"[EXAMPLE] MUN: Crisis Directives Sheet","alternateLink":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=16HHhGE2OdH4SwB6i3sHjd0aKjpjzYHenHZAhwaxvmiM","thumbnailUrl":"https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=16HHhGE2OdH4SwB6i3sHjd0aKjpjzYHenHZAhwaxvmiM&sz=s200"},"shareMode":"VIEW"}}],"state":"PUBLISHED","alternateLink":"https://classroom.google.com/c/MTIxNjk2OTk5OTY0/a/MjYxMjYzMDI0OTg4/details","creationTime":"2021-01-27T23:30:36.906Z","updateTime":"2021-03-21T06:12:29.366Z","dueDate":{"year":2021,"month":3,"day":25},"dueTime":{"hours":22,"minutes":15},"workType":"ASSIGNMENT","submissionModificationMode":"MODIFIABLE_UNTIL_TURNED_IN","creatorUserId":"107269691866792733745","topicId":"121697001073"},{"courseId":"121799388349","id":"302055654030","title":"Edpuzzle - America The Story Of Us  \"Bust\"  Dust Bowl","materials":[{"link":{"url":"https://edpuzzle.com/assignments/60538349b4a89f42646fe075/watch","title":"Edpuzzle - America The Story Of Us \"Bust\" Dust Bowl","thumbnailUrl":"https://classroom.google.com/webthumbnail?url=https://edpuzzle.com/assignments/60538349b4a89f42646fe075/watch"}}],"state":"PUBLISHED","alternateLink":"https://classroom.google.com/c/MTIxNzk5Mzg4MzQ5/a/MzAyMDU1NjU0MDMw/details","creationTime":"2021-03-18T16:43:58.093Z","updateTime":"2021-03-18T16:43:57.557Z","dueDate":{"year":2021,"month":3,"day":22},"dueTime":{"hours":6,"minutes":59},"maxPoints":100,"workType":"ASSIGNMENT","submissionModificationMode":"MODIFIABLE_UNTIL_TURNED_IN","creatorUserId":"116250658636767548943","topicId":"121799388354"},{"courseId":"115494367560","id":"302320075710","title":"Edpuzzle - AP Biology: 7.5 Hardy-Weinberg","materials":[{"link":{"url":"https://edpuzzle.com/assignments/6054b24921589f4296addec1/watch","title":"Edpuzzle - AP Biology: 7.5 Hardy-Weinberg","thumbnailUrl":"https://classroom.google.com/webthumbnail?url=https://edpuzzle.com/assignments/6054b24921589f4296addec1/watch"}}],"state":"PUBLISHED","alternateLink":"https://classroom.google.com/c/MTE1NDk0MzY3NTYw/a/MzAyMzIwMDc1NzEw/details","creationTime":"2021-03-19T14:16:43.850Z","updateTime":"2021-03-19T15:04:55.066Z","dueDate":{"year":2021,"month":3,"day":23},"dueTime":{"hours":15,"minutes":59},"maxPoints":100,"workType":"ASSIGNMENT","submissionModificationMode":"MODIFIABLE_UNTIL_TURNED_IN","creatorUserId":"111973411985720603727","topicId":"122115026050"},{"courseId":"115494367560","id":"280451532312","title":"Data Analysis: Anole Lizards","materials":[{"driveFile":{"driveFile":{"id":"1uU0NEHAfnRfUq_i-1lWzFJGVt8vXPLh6","title":"[Template] Kami Export - Data Analysis_ Anole Lizards AP BIO 20-21.pdf","alternateLink":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s6YJeJoST5_H3kS4wYn0uKgzHhacE12m","thumbnailUrl":"https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1s6YJeJoST5_H3kS4wYn0uKgzHhacE12m&sz=s200"},"shareMode":"STUDENT_COPY"}},{"link":{"url":"https://kami.app/KbiAieYzuoHA","title":"Kami & Google Classroom for Students: Remote Learning - Google Docs","thumbnailUrl":"https://classroom.google.com/webthumbnail?url=https://kami.app/KbiAieYzuoHA"}}],"state":"PUBLISHED","alternateLink":"https://classroom.google.com/c/MTE1NDk0MzY3NTYw/a/MjgwNDUxNTMyMzEy/details","creationTime":"2021-03-19T14:19:02.870Z","updateTime":"2021-03-19T15:04:47.933Z","dueDate":{"year":2021,"month":4,"day":3},"dueTime":{"hours":6,"minutes":55},"maxPoints":50,"workType":"ASSIGNMENT","submissionModificationMode":"MODIFIABLE_UNTIL_TURNED_IN","creatorUserId":"111973411985720603727","topicId":"122115026050"},{"courseId":"123017503192","id":"293816925890","title":"Chapter 24:  Binary Tree","materials":[{"driveFile":{"driveFile":{"id":"1JzYVtjrlJgSeS1nIH3dvtGn_Z7i5z4yg45qh8oY9CPg","title":"Chapter 24: Binary Tree","alternateLink":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JzYVtjrlJgSeS1nIH3dvtGn_Z7i5z4yg45qh8oY9CPg","thumbnailUrl":"https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1JzYVtjrlJgSeS1nIH3dvtGn_Z7i5z4yg45qh8oY9CPg&sz=s200"},"shareMode":"VIEW"}}],"state":"PUBLISHED","alternateLink":"https://classroom.google.com/c/MTIzMDE3NTAzMTky/a/MjkzODE2OTI1ODkw/details","creationTime":"2021-03-08T05:14:26.554Z","updateTime":"2021-03-08T05:15:08.719Z","dueDate":{"year":2021,"month":3,"day":22},"dueTime":{"hours":6,"minutes":59},"maxPoints":30,"workType":"ASSIGNMENT","submissionModificationMode":"MODIFIABLE_UNTIL_TURNED_IN","creatorUserId":"115063342685770917401","topicId":"277048946751"},{"courseId":"126299629663","id":"300630032757","title":"U5A13 - Read Chapter 24 in your eTextbook.
